# Contribute
There are many different ways to get involved in development and become a [contributor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributors). Any help is greatly appreciated!

## Report Issues
Open a [new issue](https://github.com/qCring/QuickVtk/issues/new) on GitHub and make sure to provide a description. You can also tag your issue which helps keeping things organized:

- **bug** for bug reports
- **enhancement** for features/improvements you'd like to ask for
- **question** for just asking a question
- **docs** for anything related to this documentation website

## Open a Pull-Request
Anyone is welcome to fix bugs or implement new features! Just clone the GitHub repository and use a separate branch to work on. Use many commits for larger changes and open a new pull request as soon as you're done. You can use the GitHub web interface or the [GitHub desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) to open new PRs from your cloned repo.

## Contribute to the Website
This website is based on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). All resources can be found in the project's `doc` folder. If you find typos, grammar and/or spelling errors (which is very likely) you can just report them or provide your fix in a pull request.

If you are interested in building the website on your machine, take a look at the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). If you have installed [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on your system, just navigate to the `doc` folder from the project's root directory and launch jekyll locally via `bundle exec jekyll serve`
