# Planned Changes for 0.5.7
Version 0.5.7 will focus on dropping the built-in [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) editor and a redisigning the UI. With the limited access to [QQuickTextDocument](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquicktextdocument.html) it makes more sense to remove the editor and rely on external tools such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or any other available text editor. QuickVtk already uses a [QFileSystemWatcher](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfilesystemwatcher.html) to monitor file changes and automatically compiles [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) code after the currently loaded file was modified externally.

## UI Redesign
The **Log** console will be permanently visible. Instead of switching between the **Preview** and **Log** panels, runtime warnings and errors will be easier to detect. Also, the [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) output window will use the whole application window since there is no need to provide a side-by-side view after disabling the built-in text editor.

## Changes
- The `CMakeLists.txt` file for [VTK](https://vtk.org/) moved from `libs/src` to `dependencies/src`. If you built [VTK](https://vtk.org/) from the `libs` folder, you might run into some errors. In that case, delete the `libs` folder, rebuild [VTK](https://vtk.org/) from the `dependencies` folder and rebuild QuickVtk after updating the path to [VTK](https://vtk.org/) in [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
- The `QuickVtkLibs` target was renamed to `QuickVtkCore`
- The minimum C++ version is now C++14 (previously C++11)

## Fixes
- [Issue #44](https://github.com/qCring/QuickVtk/issues/44)   
The application's root object is currently relying on [QtQuick.Controls](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols-index.html) by using the [ApplicationWindow](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls2-applicationwindow.html) type. While this allows the use of [Menu](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls2-menu.html) objects, the applications freezes after resizing the window. Version 0.5.7 will use the [Window](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-window-window.html) type instead but this makes it necessary to provide a custom implementation for the application menu.
